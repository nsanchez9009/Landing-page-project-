## My landing page project submission for The Odin Project.
---
This is a straightforward landing page for The FOOL album by Bladee. Written in HTML and CSS.

Some elements, like the tracklist, could be visually improved by removing complexity but I wanted to use everything I learned up to this point. So for my use of flex-wrap I created a card for each track and applied flex-wrap. This is why each track is listed with a spinning flower. Each flower is a card and I thought it looked pretty interesting.
